    <h2>Part I: Episode I: Old Cave people</h2>
    
    <h3>hunter Gather society bc cool</h3>
    <p>A H/G society was made up of old hairy men that walked around killing sheep and eating berries off the ground. These people would normal travel in groups, building close, personal bonds with one another. This is very important because <b>yes.</b></p>
    <h3>Agricultural Revolution</h3>
    <p>The AR was a gu - one of the most important events in histoy as it shaped the very world we live in today. The AR occured when the old hairy men settled down an started eating dogs or whatever. They would grow plants and raise animals so they would not have to walk around and eat stuff anymore. This would eventually lead to dynasties, empires, star wars, colonies, Donald Trump, and <b>Instagram reels.</b> Important note: In areas where people could not farm exp, they had to depend on the cows to do stuff. The people who depended on these animals were called herders, nomads, or <b>Pastoral Societies</b> </p>
    <h3>How did the various kinds of societies that emerged out of the Agricultural Revolution differ fron one another? (idk y r u asking me?)</h3>
  
    <ul>
      <li>Pastoral Societies had cows bc farming was hard in the area</li>
      <ul>
        <li>They moved around alot</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Farmers grew stuff</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Gener Equality</li>
        <li>artistic</li>
        <li>Chiefdoms - political farms</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>When did the sims start popping up?</h3>
    <p>The civilizations started doing stuff due to the AR. The first ones happened in Mesopotamia, Egypt, and along the central coast of Peru between 3500 to 3000 BCE. By 1200, most of the worlk lived in civilizations (Sims are societies based in cities and governed by states). Around this time, Gender inequality started popping off and pronounced patriarchy (whatever that means).</p>
    <h3>How did civilizations lead to changes in society?</h3>
    <p>Look up.</p>
    <h3>How did the environment help shape the development of civilizations? How did civilizations change the environment?</h3>
    <p>The squads that dropped near the loot chests (rivers) made up many of the cool civilizations. The high ground (mountains) in greece favored the development of enemy squads rather than a large team. 
      The tight chokepoint of the panama did not allow squads from Mesoamerica to knock those of the Andes. 
      The storm (ocean) did not allow the westerners to meet up with the others. Not only did the drop point heavaly impact the squads, but the squads also heavaly impacted the drop point.
      All of the squads scrambled to collect building resources and left ruin in their path. For example, the extensive farming in Mesopotamia turned the soil white with salt. As a result, they had to switch from wheat to barley.
      </p>
    <h3>Comparing power in Rise Of Kingdoms</h3>
    <p>While most civilizations have a number of common features, they also are very different. For example, the Arab empire gives balanced boosts to all stats (food gathering, scout speed, upgrade speed) as it encompassed much of North 
        Africa, the Middle East, and parts of spain and weastern India. Other empires such as the Mali, Songhay, and Inca offered bonus attack, but not that many other boosts, making it bad for starters (below 1mil power)
      However, civilizations such as the Greek, the Maya, and the Swahili organized themselved in competitive city-states that allowed for growth through high guild reqs.</p>
